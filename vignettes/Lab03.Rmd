In this lab session you will explore Monte Carlo integration methods.
You will not hand in anything, but you should keep your
code script file for later use.

1. Go to your project clone of your lab 2 repository.
  During the lab, store new code in one or more new files and commit and push
  them to github, as in lab 2.
2. Upgrade the `StatCompLab` package to version `>= 0.3.0`, with
`devtools::install_github("finnlindgren/StatCompLab", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
and restart you R session, via the RStudio `Session` menu.
3. Open the `Tutorial 03` tutorial in the Tutorial pane and work through the
  tasks.
