## Introduction

* In this lab session you will explore Monte Carlo integration and importance sampling.
* Open your github repository clone project from Lab 2 (either on [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) or on your own computer and
upgrade the `StatCompLab` package (see the `Lab03` vignette for more details)
* Save your work for this lab in one or several new files in the project, and commit and push the changes to github (see Lab 2 for more information)
* In your code script, start with `library(StatCompLab)` to get access to the
`arch_loglike` function needed for one of the tasks.

`r begin_sol(!.solutions)`
The accompanying `Tutorial03solutions` tutorial document contains the
solutions explicitly, to make it easier to review the material after the workshops.

## Overdispersed Poisson distribution

We'll use an _overdispersed Poisson distribution_ as the first example. In an ordinary Poisson distribution $Y\sim\pPo(\lambda)$ with expectation $\lambda$, the variance is also $\lambda$. The _coefficient of variation_ is defined as the ratio between the standard deviation and the expectation, which gives $1/\sqrt{\lambda}$. In real applications, one often observes data where the coefficient of variation is larger than the Poisson model would give.  One way of dealing with that is to add a _latent random effect_; a hidden layer of random values that "nudges" the expectation for each observation, which increases the observed coefficient of variation. The model can be written in two steps:
$$
\begin{aligned}
X & \sim \pN(0,\sigma^2), \\
(Y|X=x) & \sim \pPo[\exp(\mu + x)],
\end{aligned}
$$
where the conditional expectation for $Y$ given $X=x$ and $\mu$ is $\lambda(\mu,x)=\exp(\mu+x)$, and $\mu$ is a (fixed) parameter. The
_marginal_ expectation (but till conditionally on $\mu$ and $\sigma$) can be obtained via the tower property (law of total expectation),
$$
\begin{aligned}
\pE(Y|\mu,\sigma) &= \pE[\pE(Y|X)] = \pE[\lambda(\mu,X)] = \pE[\exp(\mu+X)] = \exp(\mu + \sigma^2/2)
\end{aligned}
$$
where the last step comes from the expectation of a log-Normal distribution.
For multiple observations, we can write the model as
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_i & \sim \pN(0,\sigma^2), \text{ independent for each $i=1,\dots,n$,}\\
(y_i|x_i) & \sim \pPo[\exp(\mu + x_i)], \text{ conditionally independent for each $i=1,\dots,n$}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Consider the following simulation code:
```{r echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
Y <- rpois(30, lambda = 2 * exp(-1/2 + rnorm(30, sd = 2)))
```
```{r quiz1,eval=.tutorial}
question(
  "What parameter value combination is used in the simulation?",
  answer("$\\mu=-1/2$, $\\sigma=2$"),
  answer("$\\mu=-1/2$, $\\sigma=4$"),
  answer("$\\mu=-1/2+\\log(2)$, $\\sigma=2$", correct = TRUE),
  answer("$\\mu=-1/2+\\log(2)$, $\\sigma=4$"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

1. **Theory exercise**:
Using the tower property (law of total variance), theoretically derive an expression for $\pVar(Y)$. You can get the needed log-Normal variance expression from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution)

`r begin_sol()`
$$
\begin{aligned}
\pVar(Y|\mu,\sigma) &= \pE[\pVar(Y|X)] + \pVar[\pE(Y|X)]
\\&=
\pE[\lambda(\mu,X)] + \pVar[\lambda(\mu,X)]
\\&=
\pE[\exp(\mu+X)] +\pVar[\exp(\mu+X)]
\\&=
\exp(\mu + \sigma^2/2)
+
(\exp(\sigma^2)-1) \exp(2\mu + \sigma^2)
\\&=
\exp(\mu + \sigma^2/2)
\left[
1
+
(\exp(\sigma^2)-1) \exp(\mu + \sigma^2/2)
\right]
\end{aligned}
$$
Since the second factor is always $\geq 1$, this shows that the variance is never smaller than the expectation.
`r end_sol()`


2. **Monte Carlo integration**:
Use Monte Carlo integration to approximate the probability mass function
$$
\begin{aligned}
p_Y(m|\mu,\sigma)=\pP(Y=m|\mu,\sigma) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \pP(Y=m|\mu,\sigma,X=x) p_X(x|\sigma) \md x
\end{aligned}
$$
for $m=0,1,2,3,\dots,15$, with $\mu=\log(2)-1/2$ and $\sigma=1$.

For this to be efficient, you should vectorise the calculations by evaluating the conditional
probability function for $Y$ over all the $m$ values at once, for each simulated value
$x^{[k]}\sim\pN(\mu,\sigma^2)$ value, for $k=1,2,\dots,K$. Use $K=10000$ samples.

Plot the resulting probability mass function $p_Y(m|\mu,\sigma)$ together with the
ordinary Poisson probability mass function with the same expectation value, $\lambda = 2$.
(Use the theory above to convince yourself that these two models for $Y$ have the same expectation.)

```{r poisson-mc,exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=22}

```

```{r poisson-mc-hint-1,eval=FALSE}
# Vectorised over m
mu <- log(2) - 1/2
K <- 10000
m <- 0:15
P_Y <- numeric(length(m))
for (loop in seq_len(K)) {
  ...
}
P_Y <- P_Y / K

# Plot the results
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
ggplot(data.frame(m = m,
                  P_Y = P_Y,
                  P_Poisson = dpois(m, lambda = 2))) +
  ...
```
```{r poisson-mc-solution,eval=FALSE}
# Vectorised over m
mu <- log(2) - 1/2
K <- 10000
m <- 0:15
P_Y <- numeric(length(m))
for (loop in seq_len(K)) {
  x <- rnorm(1, sd = 1)
  P_Y <- P_Y + dpois(m, lambda = exp(mu + x))
}
P_Y <- P_Y / K

# Plot the results
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
ggplot(data.frame(m = m,
                  P_Y = P_Y,
                  P_Poisson = dpois(m, lambda = 2))) +
  geom_point(aes(m, P_Y, col = "MC")) +
  geom_point(aes(m, P_Poisson, col = "Poisson")) +
  geom_line(aes(m, P_Y, col = "MC")) +
  geom_line(aes(m, P_Poisson, col = "Poisson"))
```

`r begin_sol()`
```{r poisson-mc-show,echo=.solutions,eval=.solutions,ref.label="poisson-mc-solution"}
```

In the plot, the overdispersed Poisson probability function (that we just computed) is compared with the plain Poisson probability function for the same expectation value. Lines between values are included for clarity.
Note:
In this case, the second approach is faster, but in other situations the first approach is required, since it doesn't require storing all the random numbers at the same time, thus allowing for a much larger $K=n_{\text{mc}}$ value to be used.
`r end_sol()`

3. **Reusable function**:
Generalise the code to a function `doverpois` (for "d"ensity for over-dispersed Poisson)
that takes `m`, `mu`, `sigma`, and `K` as input
and returns a `data.frame` suitable for use with `ggplot`.

```{r poisson-mc2,exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=12}

```

```{r poisson-mc2-solution,eval=FALSE}
doverpois <- function(m, mu, sigma, K) {
  P_Y <- numeric(length(m))
  for (loop in seq_len(K)) {
    x <- rnorm(1, sd = sigma)
    P_Y <- P_Y + dpois(m, lambda = exp(mu + x))
  }
  P_Y <- P_Y / K

  data.frame(m = m,
             P_Y = P_Y,
             P_Poisson = dpois(m, lambda = exp(mu + sigma^2/2)))
}
```

`r begin_sol()`
```{r poisson-mc2-show,echo=.solutions,eval=.solutions,ref.label="poisson-mc2-solution",results="hide"}
```
`r end_sol()`

Use the function to plot results for $\mu=\log(8)-1/8$, $\sigma = 1/2$, with $m=0,1,\dots,30$ by adding geoms to
```{r eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
ggplot(doverpois(m = 0:30, mu = log(8) - 0.125, sigma = 0.5, K = 10000))
```

`r begin_sol()`
```{r poisson-mc2-plot,echo=.solutions,eval=.solutions}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
ggplot(doverpois(m = 0:30, mu = log(8)-0.125, sigma = 0.5, K = 10000)) +
  geom_point(aes(m, P_Y, col = "MC")) +
  geom_point(aes(m, P_Poisson, col = "Poisson")) +
  geom_line(aes(m, P_Y, col = "MC")) +
  geom_line(aes(m, P_Poisson, col = "Poisson"))
```
`r end_sol()`




## Archaeology in the Baltic sea

![The Waldemar cross, source: Wikipedia](images/Waldemarkreuz_wikipedia.png)

Original inscription, in Latin:
<blockquote>
  ``Anno Domini MCCCLXI feria III post Jacobi ante portas Visby in manibus
  Danorum ceciderunt Gutenses, hic sepulti, orate pro eis!''
</blockquote>
  <!--
<blockquote>
    "I Herrens {\aa}r 1361, tredje dagen efter S:t Jacob, f\"oll utanf\"or
    Visbys portar gutarna i danskarnas h\"ander. H\"ar \"ar de begravda.
    Bed f\"or dem."
</blockquote>
-->

English translation:
<blockquote>
    ``In the year of our Lord 1361, on the third day after St.\ Jacob,
    the Goth fell outside the gates of Visby at the hands of the Danish.
    They are buried here. Pray for them!''
</blockquote>

Strategically located in the middle of the Baltic
  sea, the island of Gotland had shifting periods of being partly self-governed, and
  in partial control by the Hanseatic trading alliance, Sweden,
  Denmark, and the Denmark-Norway-Sweden union, until settling as part
  of Sweden in 1645.
  Gotland has an abundance of archaeological
  treasures, with coins dating back to Viking era trade routes via
  Russia to the Arab Caliphates. and captured the rich Hanseatic town
of Visby.

  In 1361 the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag conquered
Gotland. The conquest was followed by a plunder of Visby.
Most of the defenders (primarily local farmers that could not take shelter
inside the city walls) were killed in the attack
and are buried in a field, _Korsbetningen_ (Literal translation: _the grazing
field that is marked by a cross_, as shown in the picture), outside of the walls of Visby.

In the 1920s
the gravesite was subject to several archaeological excavations.  A
total of $493$ femurs (thigh bones)
($256$ left, and $237$ right) were found.  We want to figure out how many
persons were likely buried at the gravesite.  It must reasonably have
been at least $256$, but how many more?

### Statistical model

To build a simple model for this problem, we assume that the number of
left ($y_1=256$) and right ($y_2=237$) femurs are two independent observations
from a $\pBin(N,\phi)$ distribution.  Here $N$ is the total
number of people buried and $\phi$ is the probability of finding a
femur, left or right, and both $N$ and $\phi$ are unknown parameters.

The probability function for a single observation $y\sim\pBin(N,\phi)$ is
\begin{align*}
p(y|N,\phi) &= {N \choose y} \phi^y (1-\phi)^{N-y} .
\end{align*}
The function `arch_loglike()` in the `StatCompLab` package evaluates the
combined log-likelihood
$\log[p(\mv{y}|N,\phi)]$ for a collection $\mv{y}$ of $y$-observations. If a
`data.frame` with columns `N` and `phi` is provided, the
log-likelihood for each row-pair $(N,\phi)$ is returned.

The combined \emph{log-likelihood} $l(y_1,y_2|N,\theta)=\log p(y_1,y_2|N,\phi)$ for the data set $\{y_1,y_2\}$ is then given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
l(y_1,y_2|N,\theta) &= -\log\Gamma(y_1+1) - \log\Gamma(y_2+1)
\\&\phantom{=~}
- \log\Gamma(N-y_1+1) - \log\Gamma(N-y_2+1)
+ 2\log\Gamma(N+1)
\\&\phantom{=~}
 + (y_1+y_2) \log(\phi) + (2 N - y_1 - y_2)\log(1-\phi)
\end{aligned}
$$

The task is to use Monte Carlo integration to estimate the posterior expectations of $N$ and $\phi$, when the prior distributions are $N\sim\pGeom(\xi)$, $0<\xi<1$, and $\phi\sim\pBeta(a, b)$, $a,b>0$.

The mathematical definitions are:
Let $N$ have a $\pGeom(\xi)$, $\xi>0$, prior distribution, and let $\phi$ have a $\pBeta(a,b)$, $a,b>0$,
prior distribution:
$$
\begin{aligned}
p_N(n) = \pP(N=n) &= \xi\,(1-\xi)^n,\quad n=0,1,2,3,\dots, \\
p_\phi(\phi) &= \frac{\phi^{a-1}(1-\phi)^{b-1}}{B(a,b)}, \quad \phi\in[0,1] .
\end{aligned}
$$
and the probability mass function $p_N(n)$ can be evaluated with `dgeom()` in R, and the density $p_\phi(\phi)$ can be evaluated with `dbeta`.

### Bayesian estimation

Before the excavation took place, the archaeologist believed that around $1000$ individuals were buried, and that they would find around half on the femurs.  To encode that belief in the Bayesian analysis, set $\xi=1/(1+1000)$, which corresponds to an expected total count of $1000$, and $a=b=2$, which makes $\phi$ more likely to be close to $1/2$ than to $0$ or $1$.

The posterior density/probability function for $(N,\phi|\mv{y})$ is
$$
\begin{aligned}
p_{N,\phi|\mv{y}}(n,\phi|\mv{y}) &=
\frac{p_{N,\phi,\mv{y}}(n,\phi,\mv{y})}{p_{\mv{y}}(\mv{y})}
= \frac{p_N(n)p_\phi(\phi)p(\mv{y}|n,\phi)}{p_{\mv{y}}(\mv{y})}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can estimate $p_{\mv{y}}(\mv{y})$ with Monte Carlo integration, the the same time as
using importance sampling to estimate the posterior expectations. The theoretical expressions
$$
\begin{aligned}
p_{\mv{y}}(\mv{y}) &=
\sum_{n=\max(y_1,y_2)}^\infty \int_0^1 p_{N,\phi,\mv{y}}(n,\phi,\mv{y}) \md\phi =
\sum_{n=\max(y_1,y_2)}^\infty \int_0^1 p(\mv{y}|n,\phi) p_N(n) p_\phi(\phi) \md\phi\\
\pE(N|\mv{y}) &=
\sum_{n=\max(y_1,y_2)}^\infty \int_0^1 n\,p_{N,\phi|\mv{y}}(n,\phi) \md\phi =
\sum_{n=\max(y_1,y_2)}^\infty \int_0^1 n\,\frac{p(\mv{y}|n,\phi)}{p_{\mv{y}}(\mv{y})} p_N(n) p_\phi(\phi) \md\phi\\
\pE(\phi|\mv{y}) &=
\sum_{n=\max(y_1,y_2)}^\infty \int_0^1 \phi\,p_{N,\phi|\mv{y}}(n,\phi) \md\phi =
\sum_{n=\max(y_1,y_2)}^\infty \int_0^1 \phi\,\frac{p(\mv{y}|n,\phi)}{p_{\mv{y}}(\mv{y})} p_N(n) p_\phi(\phi)
\md\phi
\end{aligned}
$$

### Monte Carlo integration

What might a good choice of sampling distribution be?  In this first approach to the problem, let's use the prior distributions as sampling distributions for the Monte Carlo integration.
This means that we need to sample $n^{[k]}\sim\pGeom(\xi)$ and $\phi^{[k]}\sim\pBeta(a,b)$,
and compute Monte Carlo estimates
$$
\begin{aligned}
\wh{p}_{\mv{y}}(\mv{y}) &=
\frac{1}{K}
  \sum_{k=1}^K p(\mv{y}|n^{[k]},\phi^{[k]})\\
\wh{\pE}(N|\mv{y}) &=
  \frac{1}{K \wh{p}_{\mv{y}}(\mv{y})}
  \sum_{k=1}^K n^{[k]} p(\mv{y}|n^{[k]},\phi^{[k]})\\
\wh{\pE}(\phi|\mv{y}) &=
  \frac{1}{K \wh{p}_{\mv{y}}(\mv{y})}
  \sum_{k=1}^K \phi^{[k]} p(\mv{y}|n^{[k]},\phi^{[k]})\\
\end{aligned}
$$
Write a function `estimate` that takes inputs `y`, `xi`, `a`, `b`, and `K` and implements the above Monte Carlo integration method.

```{r archaeology-mc, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=12}

```
```{r archaeology-mc-hint-1,eval=FALSE}
estimate <- function(y, xi, a, b, K) {
  samples <- data.frame(
    N = rgeom(K, prob = xi),
    phi = rbeta(K, shape1 = a, shape2 = b)
  )
  loglike <- arch_loglike(param = samples, y = y)
  ...
}
```
```{r archaeology-mc-solution,eval=FALSE}
estimate <- function(y, xi, a, b, K) {
  samples <- data.frame(
    N = rgeom(K, prob = xi),
    phi = rbeta(K, shape1 = a, shape2 = b)
  )
  loglike <- arch_loglike(param = samples, y = y)
  p_y <- mean(exp(loglike))
  c(p_y = p_y,
    E_N = mean(samples$N * exp(loglike) / p_y),
    E_phi = mean(samples$phi * exp(loglike) / p_y))
}
```

Test the function by running `estimate(y=c(237,256), xi=1/1001, a=0.5, b=0.5, K=10000)`

`r begin_sol()`
```{r archaeology-mc-show,echo=.solutions,eval=.solutions,ref.label="archaeology-mc-solution",results="hide"}
```
```{r archaeology-mc-show,echo=.solutions,eval=.solutions}
estimate(y = c(237, 256), xi = 1/1001, a = 0.5, b = 0.5, K = 10000)
```
`r end_sol()`

Note: as shown in lecture 3, the conditional posterior distribution for $\phi$ for fixed $N=n$ is $(\phi|n,\mv{y})\sim \pBeta(a+y_1+y_2,b+2n-y_1-y_2)$. This can be used to construct a potentially more efficient method, where each $\phi^{[k]}$ is sampled conditionally on $n^{[k]}$, and the integration importance weights adjusted appropriately.
